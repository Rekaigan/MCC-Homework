    <body>
    <p style="width: 400px;"> <b>Part 1:</b> Something is wrong with the create person function - I keep getting undefined from it. Fix the function.</p>
    <p style="width: 400px;"> <b>Part 2:</b> Write a for loop to print out the details of each person in the person array. I want you to print out their name, their height, and their age.</p>
