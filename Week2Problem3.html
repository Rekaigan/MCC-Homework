    <p style="width: 400px;"> The variable myarrays contains four arrays, each with a decreasing sequence of numbers. I want you to write a for loop that loops through each array in myarrays, and then within that, a for loop which loops through that array backwards and prints out each number using console.log. You should end up with the numbers 1 to 20 being printed out in order.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Remember, you can nest for loops (have for loops inside for loops)</li>
    <li>You can also set the initial conditions, while conditions, and modifiers for a for loop to count backwards instead of forwards.</li>
