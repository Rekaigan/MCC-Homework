    <p style="width: 400px;"> Modify the while loop in this code to exit as soon as it finds a number in numarray which is larger than 20. The if clause at the bottom of the script should then print out:<p> "Target was found at index: 5"</p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>I don't want you to use break or continue statements.</li>
        <li>I want you to use the 'found' boolean I have defined. <i>Hint: By the time the while loop has exited, found should be true</i></li>
        <li>This means you will need to have some sort of if statement inside the while loop to modify 'found' if you find a number >20</li>
        <li>It also means you need to modify the while condition, using <i>found</i> somehow</li>
        <li>Hint: you will need to use 'and' (&&)</li>
        <li>Be careful!</li>
        <ul>
            <li>It is easy to make this while loop an infinite loop accidentally</li>
            <li>Make sure you bracket your conditions when using && in the while loop</li>
            <li>Make sure your index doesn't end up 'off by one' - the correct answer is 5, not 6.</ul>
